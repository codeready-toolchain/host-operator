    Dear {{.FirstName}} {{.LastName}},
  </p>

  <p>
    Welcome to Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline! This new platform saves you weeks of time by automating the onboarding process for containerized apps with CI/CD. It also offers granular customization for build pipelines. And it provides unparalleled security for your software supply chain.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have enabled your access, so to get started, you can now visit {{.RegistrationURL}} and select + <b>Create an application</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’d rather access Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline through your CLI, or if you have any questions that are not answered in the web UI, you can also visit our community documentation at https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/appstudio.docs.ui.io/.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project is still in its early days, so we would love your feedback! To interact with our team, you can join the DevNation Slack workspace here: https://dn.dev/slack, and then join our #software-supply-chain-security channel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please be aware that, currently, your access is part of a private preview release. Private preview releases provide early access to a limited set of features that might not be fully tested. Users should not use private preview software in production or for business-critical workloads.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your interest. We look forward to having your feedback.
  </p>

  <p>
    Best Regards,<br />
    The Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline team
