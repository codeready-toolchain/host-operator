    Dear {{.FirstName}} {{.LastName}},
  </p>

  <p>
    Welcome to Red Hat CI/CD! This new platform saves you weeks of time by automating the onboarding process for containerized apps with CI/CD. It also offers granular customization for build pipelines. And it provides unparalleled security for your software supply chain.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have enabled your access, so to get started, you can now visit {{.RegistrationURL}} and select + <b>Create an application</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’d rather access Red Hat CI/CD through your CLI, or if you have any questions that are not answered in the web UI, you can also visit our documentation at https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.stonesoup.io/Documentation/main/index.html.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project is still in its early days, so we would love your feedback! To interact with our team, you can join the DevNation Slack workspace here: https://dn.dev/DevNationSlack, and then join our #software-supply-chain-security channel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your interest. We look forward to having your feedback about Red Hat CI/CD.
  </p>

  <p>
    Best Regards,<br />
    The Red Hat CI/CD team
