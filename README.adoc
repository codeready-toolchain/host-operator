This is the CodeReady Toolchain Host Operator repository. It contains the OpenShift Operator that is deployed on the "host" cluster in the SaaS.

== Build

Requires Go version 1.12.6 - download for your development environment https://golang.org/dl/[here].

This repository uses https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go modules]. You may need to `export GO111MODULE=on` to turn modules support "on".

== Development

To run this operator locally you need to have at least one Minishift profile started:

```bash
$ minishift start --profile host
```

Then you can run the operator locally with the help of `operator-sdk`:

```bash
$ make up-local
```

That Makefile target takes care of additional several steps which can be executed separately:

* logging as system:admin user: `$ make login-as-admin`
* creating local test namespace: `$ make create-namespace`
* deploy CRDs: `$ make deploy-crd`
* building the project: `$ make build`
* deploying ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding and creating ServiceAccount: `$ make deploy-rbac`

There are a few more targets that you can find useful:

* to login as system:admin user and enter the local test namespace: `$ make use-namespace`
* to remove the local test namespace: `$ make clean-namespace`
* to remove & create the local test namespace, and create ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding and ServiceAccount inside of the namespace: `$ make reset-namespace`


=== Adding cluster to SaaS

The CodeReady Toolchain architecture contains two types of clusters `host` and `member`.
To connect these two clusters together it is necessary to run a script link:https://github.com/codeready-toolchain/toolchain/scripts/add-cluster.sh[add-cluster.sh] that is part of the link:https://github.com/codeready-toolchain/toolchain[toolchain] repository.
For more detailed information about the script see the link:https://github.com/codeready-toolchain/toolchain#add-clustersh[README "Script add-cluster.sh" chapter].

There are two Makefile targets available in this repository that execute the script:

*  `$ make add-member-to-host` that executes `../toolchain/scripts/add-cluster.sh member member-cluster`
*  `$ make add-host-to-member` that executes `../toolchain/scripts/add-cluster.sh host host-cluster`

NOTE: In order to run them, you need to have the link:https://github.com/codeready-toolchain/toolchain[toolchain] repository cloned to the same parent directory as this repository exists in.
