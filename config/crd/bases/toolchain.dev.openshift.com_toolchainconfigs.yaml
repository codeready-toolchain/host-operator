                          How this works:
                          - backend returns a weight
                          - old UI assigns a sticky random number for each user

                          - if the user has a number above the weight they keep using the current UI
                        maximum: 100

                              Verification enablement works in the following way:

                                   No verification during the signup process at all. (no phone, no captcha)
                                2. verification.enabled == true && verification.captcha.enabled == true
                                   Captcha is enabled and will bypass phone verification if the score is above the threshold but if the score is
                                   below the threshold then phone verification kicks in.
                                3. verification.enabled == true && verification.captcha.enabled == false
                                   Only phone verification is effect.

                            Such manifests must have an annotation which refers to the corresponding feature name.
                            For example a manifest for a RoleBinding object in a space tier template with the following annotation:
                            "toolchain.dev.openshift.com/feature: os-lightspeed" would refer to a feature with "os-lightspeed" name.
                            When that template is applied for a new space then that RoleBinding object would be applied conditionally,
                            according to its weight.

                                If not set then 100 is used by default.
                                0 means the corresponding feature should not be enabled at all, which means
                                that corresponding template objects should not be applied at all.
                                100 means the feature should be always enabled (the template is always applied).
                                The features are weighted independently of each other.
                                For example if there are two features:
                                - feature1, weight=5
                                - feature2, weight=90

                                - RoleBinding with "toolchain.dev.openshift.com/feature: feature1" annotation
                                - ConfigMap with "toolchain.dev.openshift.com/feature: feature2" annotation
                                Then the RoleBinding will be created for the corresponding tiers with probability of 0.05 (around 5 out of every 100 spaces would have it)
                                And the ConfigMap will be created with probability of 0.9 (around 90 out of every 100 spaces would have it)
